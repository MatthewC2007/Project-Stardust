# **Project-Stardust**
# The purpose of the digital outcome is to help advance children between the ages of 5-13 with their education and knowledge. 
# My program could benefit the users by giving them new knowledge and facts that could help them later on.
# If kids are interested in history, there are many articles for kids who wish to learn something history related.
# This could give them a jumpstart in their learning and help them think more. 
# While it wouldn’t be able to cover lots of topics, the topics selected should be interesting and peak a child’s interest, depending on their age.

# **User manual**
# The first thing that is required is to install the customtkinter library and the Wikipedia library: 
#    https://pypi.org/project/customtkinter/ 
#   https://pypi.org/project/wikipedia/ 
# When the user first loads the app, the app takes between 5-60 seconds to load as it has to source all of the Wikipedia summaries from the internet which can take a while.
# Once loaded, the user begins on a welcome page. There is a title, a slogan, a quit button(closes the app), and a next button. The next button brings the user to a menu page.
# On the menu page there is a back button which takes the user back to the welcome page, an exit button which closes the program, a settings button, and 6 buttons with different topics.
# When the user clicks on the settings button, the user is taken to a settings page. On the settings page there is a back button which takes the user back to the menu,
# a light mode button which turns the whole app white mode, and a dark mode button which turns the whole app dark mode.
# Each of the 6 buttons on the menu page takes the user to a page with an article/wikipedia page summary.
# On this page there is a back button which takes the user back to the menu, and a next button which takes the user to the next page. 
# The next page displays a question about the page they have just read and gives them a multiple choice consisting of 4 multiple choice buttons.
# There is a back button which takes the user back to the article page. Once the user gets the question correct by clicking on the correct button, the next button appears,
# allowing the user to progress to the next page. On the next page, there is a similar layout like the previous page. A different question with different multichoice options,
# back button takes the user back to the previous page, the next button is shown once the user has gotten the question right. The next button takes the user to the credits page.
# The credit page gives a thank you to the user, advice to check out Wikipedia or relevant information regarding the topic they just learnt about, who made the program, the version number, 
# promises for future updates like a mainstream application would, a thanks for support mentioning teachers, friends and family, a back to menu button, and a quit button. 
# The quit button still quits, and the back to menu button takes the user back to the menu. 
# Each of the 6 buttons take the user to a different page page with a different article with different question pages and questions. 
# But the number of question pages and multichoice buttons remains the same. The credit page is only one page, and all of the 6 different pages end up taking you there.
# Once the user is done with the app, they can click quit anywhere on the app and the app will quit
